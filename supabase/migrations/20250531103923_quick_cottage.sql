  # Create posts table and security policies

  1. New Tables
    - `posts`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `title` (text)
      - `content` (text)
      - `user_id` (uuid, references auth.users)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)
      - `published` (boolean)
      - `location` (text)
      - `duration` (text)
      - `difficulty` (text)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `posts` table
    - Add policies for authenticated users to manage their own posts
    - Add policy for admin users to manage all posts
    - Add policy for public to read published posts
